  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px"> I'm Justin Silva, and I'm on an exciting journey of transformation from being a passionate 6th-grade teacher to a budding web developer.<br>
  With five years of experience nurturing young minds in the classroom, I've honed my skills in patience, problem-solving, and effective communication.<br>
  Qualities that I believe will serve me well in the world of web development.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px"> My transition into web development is driven by my fascination with technology and my desire to create digital solutions that enhance the way we live, work, and connect online. <br>
  As I embark on this new adventure, I'm eager to apply my teaching background to simplify complex concepts and make web development accessible to everyone. </p>
  
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Join me on this learning journey as I build, code, and create web experiences that empower and inspire. 
  Together, we can turn pixels and code into meaningful digital stories.</p> 
  
  <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p>
     
  <p>Let's embark on this exciting path of growth and innovation together!
